      Recipe Combiner Pro is a database driven website that catalogs recipes for
      use in a home kitchen and bakery. This database will hold 5000 recipes
      while using 1000 ingredients and 50 kitchen tools. The database will also
      contain times spent for preparation, from just a couple minutes to a
      couple days (for recipes that require setting and fermentation). The end
      purpose is to make home cooking easier by planning the recipes you can
      make with the time limitation you have as well as preventing food waste,
      by helping you use ingredients you already have on hand. Each recipe will
      be associated with at least one ingredient, cooking time, equipment, and
      category the recipe type belongs to.
